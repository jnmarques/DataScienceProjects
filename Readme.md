# My Journey To Become a Data Scientist

This is repository where i will keep my portfolio with the things I've learned over time.

## Manifesto to Myself
1. I will change my approach to machine learning to learn by doing instead of learn and then do.
2. 'm best when i understand the theory behind the implementation. So i will, at least, try to learn the mathematical background behind every algorithm i try to apply. Simply applying is not enough for me to feel confident about my knowledge.
3. I will try different approaches to every problem and compare the results trying to understand why a algorithm works better to that data then others.
4. ... (This is a growing list, and i will change it whenever i feel like i need a change to improve my learning)



## Work Plans
I plan on developing my knowledge using different data sets. I will start by using the data sets compiled in this blog:

For convenience i will download the data and organize it in different folders. I decided to create only on repository for all data sets instead of multiple repositories because i want to easily keep track of progress keeping my Github page organized, with the added bonus that if someone thinks of doing the same as me it can simply fork the repository or add their own solutions to the correspondent folder. Since i will have different data sets and develop on them i will have to keep the commits and folders organized. So i will use the format "#DATASET_NAME - Commit Description Goes here" to identify that a commit is correspondent to a certain dataset.
